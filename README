This project is called Jefe's Database and it was created by the Jefe's Enthusiasts
Group for CS3200 with Dr. Mark Fontenot. The contributors to this project are Kate
Stuntz, Risha Ranjan, and Claire Mahon.

The purpose of this project is to create a database using MySQL that encompasses
information that is necessary for the Mexican chain restaurant, El Jefe's Taqueria, to
run. The project has 3 main users in mind: customers, store managers, and investors.
Each of these customers has their own directory in this project that allows for them
to execute the proper functions necessary for their persona. Python was used to write
the functions for each of the personas and we utilized the Flask API.

In order to properly run this code, you must have Docker downloaded. To start the containers
use "docker compose build" and then "docker compose up". The port for this project is
8001 instead of 4000. This project was written to be used in conjunction with our
Appsmith project. The name of our project is Jefe's and it is under the Jefe's Enthusiasts
workspace on the CS3200 server.
