This project is called Jefe's Database and it was created by the Jefe's Enthusiasts
Group for CS3200 with Dr. Mark Fontenot. The contributors to this project are Kate
Stuntz, Risha Ranjan, and Claire Mahon.

The purpose of this project is to create a database using MySQL that encompasses
information that is necessary for the Mexican chain restaurant, El Jefe's Taqueria, to
run. The project has 3 main users in mind: customers, store managers, and investors.
Each of these customers has their own directory in this project that allows for them
to execute the proper functions necessary for their persona. Python was used to write
the functions for each of the personas and we utilized the Flask API.

In order to properly run this code, you must have Docker downloaded. To start the containers
use "docker compose build" and then "docker compose up". The port for this project is
8001 instead of 4000. This project was written to be used in conjunction with our
Appsmith project. The name of our project is Jefe's and it is under the Jefe's Enthusiasts
workspace on the CS3200 server.

In the Appsmith, when you deploy the app, you will initially be brought to the homepage. From
the homepage, you are given the option of which persona you want to be. Once you click that, you
are brought to login for that persona. An id that will work for the customer login is: 12355. An id
that will work for the store manager is: 100. An id that will work for the investor is: 103. If
the id does not exist in the system, you will be notified as such. Once you are logged in, you will
have different options for each persona. With the customer you can view ingredients the different
stores, check for stores in a given zip code, view your previous orders, and place new orders.
If you are an investor, you can view past investments and make investments. Store managers can
view average weight times as their location.
